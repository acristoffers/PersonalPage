One pain point of IoT, technology usually applied in CPS, is that embedded devices are usually low energy and do not have enough processing power to operate while keeping up with security measures, such as encryption and data validation. As a result, attackers may use such devices to launch attacks on the network, compromising the whole CPS infrastructure. One common type of attack is the False Data Injection (FDI), in which the attacker has access to a communication channel and can change the value read by a sensor or sent to an actuator. One way of coping with such attacks is to develop a bank of observer by using Functional Observers, which are better suited for high-dimensional, sparse systems. It does not suffer from sparsity's numerical problems and uses a reduced-order system to observe only the desired states, significantly reducing the computational burden of the observer. We propose an LMI-based approach to design a bank of residual generators for functional observers to detect such attacks. This approach has the advantage of using a reduced order arbitrary dynamic system, making it suitable for large-scale smart grids, and the use of LMI, allowing the easy insertion of restrictions. \")])])},function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"publication\"},[_c('h2',[_c('a',{attrs:{\"href\":\"#\",\"targe\":\"_blank\"}},[_vm._v(\" E SOUSA, ÁLAN C.; MESSAI, NADHIR; MANAMANNI, NOUREDINNE (2022).

However, the attack surface also grows with more equipment in the network, making it necessary to secure appropriately. With more sensors distributed on the network, it becomes easier for an attacker to hack into one and send false information to the central to destabilize the power generation and distribution. Load-altering attacks do precisely that and have a destructive potential since the generator reaction can cause network instability. Traditional techniques, like those based on the Kalman filter, for example, may pose numerical issues due to the large size and sparsity of the system matrices, failing to provide good results or wasting computational resources.

In this study, a system of coupled tanks, present in CEFET Campus V's Signals and System Analysis laboratory, was modelled in 6 different configurations. The system is composed of 4 water tanks, two on the top shelf and two on the bottom, with valves that allow the water to flow to its sibling or the one directly below it. The valves allow the user to chose how the water will flow through them. We developed a model for each configuration using physical laws of water flow in cylindrical recipients and estimated the values of the constants through tests. The models are represented using state-space, as it allows to identify the dynamics of the system internal energy, as well as the use of modern control techniques.

Beyond the research and tests on industrial facilities, the simplicity of the proposed platform allows its use also for educational and training purposes. Therefore, the proposed platform can help students focus on system analysis and control theory instead of hardware interfacing issues, while using low cost hardware. Developed in a client-server scheme, the platform can run in affordable computers while taking advantage of high-level mathematical and graphical tools available in Python language, allowing rapid implementation of advanced controllers. The use of this platform is illustrated with an implementation of a model predictive control (MPC) of a level control in a laboratory-scale process.

The studied controller is composed of a state feedback and a discrete integrator in time withfuzzy-type gains. However the adopted structure is not a PDC(parallel distributed compensation). The synthesisof the fuzzy gains is done via convex optimization procedures that aim to maximize the attraction region in thepresence of exogenous signals limited in amplitude. This allows the implementation of the reference tracking,ensuring the convergence of the controlled variable to the desired reference value.
