Through it, it's possible to obtain mathematical expressions that describe the behaviour of the real system, allowing, for example, to simulate its evolution in time as a response to some input stimulus without actually operating the real system. They also allow the creation of control laws that are mathematically correct and adequate to the system, allowing the development of formally correct and performant controllers. In this study, a system of coupled tanks, present in CEFET Campus V's Signals and System Analysis laboratory, was modelled in 6 different configurations. The system is composed of 4 water tanks, two on the top shelf and two on the bottom, with valves that allow the water to flow to its sibling or the one directly below it. The valves allow the user to chose how the water will flow through them. We developed a model for each configuration using physical laws of water flow in cylindrical recipients and estimated the values of the constants through tests. The models are represented using state-space, as it allows to identify the dynamics of the system internal energy, as well as the use of modern control techniques. Each model was validated against the real system to measure its correctness. The models obtained are available for students of the laboratory, both undergraduate and postgraduate, to streamline the study of system analysis and control theory.

The code of the controllers is written in the open-source Python language, facilitating the translation of code usually written in commercial software. The proposed platform can use from Arduinos to Programmable Logic Computers (PLCs). Beyond the research and tests on industrial facilities, the simplicity of the proposed platform allows its use also for educational and training purposes. Therefore, the proposed platform can help students focus on system analysis and control theory instead of hardware interfacing issues, while using low cost hardware. Developed in a client-server scheme, the platform can run in affordable computers while taking advantage of high-level mathematical and graphical tools available in Python language, allowing rapid implementation of advanced controllers. The use of this platform is illustrated with an implementation of a model predictive control (MPC) of a level control in a laboratory-scale process. A PLC is used to take the level measures, to dispatch control signals, and also for interlocking secure tasks. The controller runs on a Raspberry Pi computer that communicates with the PLC through an ethernet link.

For that they utilize a real system of coupled tankswith a nonlinearity and sensors and actuators withindustrial characteristics. Takagi-Sugeno's fuzzy modeling is adopted to obtain a representation of this systemin discrete time. The studied controller is composed of a state feedback and a discrete integrator in time withfuzzy-type gains. However the adopted structure is not a PDC(parallel distributed compensation). The synthesisof the fuzzy gains is done via convex optimization procedures that aim to maximize the attraction region in thepresence of exogenous signals limited in amplitude. This allows the implementation of the reference tracking,ensuring the convergence of the controlled variable to the desired reference value. A PLC (programmable logiccontroller) is used for safety interlocking and also as an interface between the controlled system and the com-puter that implements the fuzzy controller in the Python language.
