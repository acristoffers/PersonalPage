    'about_me': `Mechatronic engineering student with experience in system analysis and control and programming. Loves to work in a cooperative environment towards solving complex problems. Has worked in two scientific initiations toward using an advanced control technique (Model Predictive Control). Loves to learn languages and to help others develop their projects.`,

    'tb_ss1_desc': 'This application was developed for the firefighter corporation of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, to manage the tests applied to the newcomers, as well as anual tests.',
    'tb_ss2_desc': 'It lets them generate the tests using a simple interface, generating tests by question level or manual selection, objective or discursive, and can generate tests with question and answers in a random order, while keeping it easy to grade.',

    'cefss_desc': 'Source code for bare-minimum applications to get started with Chromium Embedded Framework versions 1 and 3. Sets up a window, loads a HTML file and creates bidirectional binding between Javascript and C++ to show the very basic of a C++ application with HTML UI.',
    'ahio_desc': 'ahio is a communication library whose goal is to abstract the interfacing with various I/O hardwares, so that changing hardware becomes possible with minimum code modification.',
    'moirai_desc': 'Moirai is the backend of the control platform. It is developed as part of my scientific initiation project, named Plataformas de baixo custo para controle de processos (low-cost platform for process control), developed at CEFET-MG (Brazil) under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Valter Leite. The project was developed through a FAPEMIG scholarship. Controllers for this platform are written in Python 3 and can use any librarie available in the computer where moirai is running. It already depends on NumPy and SciPy, as they are commonly used. This platform manages the hardware interfacing through the ahio libray, so extending it\'s hardware capabilities is a question of extending AHIO, which should be simple. Execution time, sampling time, input querying and output updating is managed by the application and let\'s you focus on your controller/model.',
    'lachesis_desc': 'Lachesis is the frontend of the control platform. This application allows you to configure the hardware, execute system response tests and run controllers with an easy to use interface. The used input and output signals, as well as variables, can be seen graphically, updating in real time. It works only as a frontend, meaning that all data is stored and managed in/by the moirai server. The server is also responsible for executing the controller. That means that you can install moirai in a dedicated computer, like a Raspberry Pi, and Lachesis in another one, using Lachesis like a remote control for your control system. This allows various user to share plant configuration.',
    'lachesis1_desc': 'Setting up the hardware is as easy as filling a form.',
    'lachesis2_desc': 'Visualize the control waveform before running open-loop tests.',
    'lachesis3_desc': 'Simply choose the sampling time, execution duration and inputs. No need to worry about handling those. Now you can focus on your controller, which can be written in Python 3, a high-level and modern programming language.',
    'lachesis4_desc': 'Visualize inputs, outputs and logged variables graphically in real-time. When the test is finished the data can be exported to JSON, CSV and MAT.',
    'tracker_desc': 'Application to track packages using Correios site as backend. It doesn\'t work anymore as it makes no sense to update it now that Correios has its own application. However, the source code is kept on GitHub for reference.',
